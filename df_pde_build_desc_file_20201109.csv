148288,BuildScriptGenerator should not force an order to set configInfo and archivesFormat,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"The eclipse.buildScript task is written in such a way that it requires the configInfo attribute to be set first if the archivesFormat attribute is to have any effect.  When invoking an Ant task from inside a <macrodef>, there seems to be no guarantee on the the order the task attribute setters will be invoked. In general it seems that Ant attempts to set task attributes in the order the attributes appear in the build script, but this is NOT the case when the task appears inside a macrodef.  My build script calls eclipse.buildScript from inside a macrodef, and the behavior that I am seeing is that BuildScriptGeneratorTask#setArchivesFormat is always being called before BuildScriptGeneratorTask#setConfigInfo, no matter what the order of the archivesFormat and configInfo parameters are. This means that the archivesFormat parameter is effectively useless when using eclipse.buildScript from a macrodef.  In general, it's a bad idea for these two attributes to be order dependent, since this is not documented anywhere and is not obvious unless looking at the pde build code.  I propose refactoring BuildScriptGenerator so that setArchivesFormat can be called after AbstractScriptGenerator#setConfigInfo.  This behavior appears in the 3.2RC7 and the latest org.eclipse.pde.build from CVS.",2006-06-22 15:38 EDT by Ben Pryor    ,2007-04-19 16:58 EDT       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/BuildScriptGenerator.java
148782,Let's re-design how source is associated with code.,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"I've never quite understood how we ended up with the ""feature based"" method of association source plugins and code plugins, but seems like one lesson of Callisto is that it doesn't really fit the desired work flow.   There is a related bug 148407, but what I wanted to document here was more use-cases as needed by a Callisto sort of project.   I think the main work flow model should be ""install everything runtime only"", but select those things you want source for. The selected source would be everthing, one or two plugins, or, I suppose a whole feature, it could also be done as part of the update/install operation, for those who know in advance what they want, but in some cases, the source may not be needed until (much) later while debuggin some problem.   Also, seems if runtime is installed first, and then later, selected source is installed, it is only good download design to download exactly what is needed, and not re-download or install the runtime code.   Seems to me that 'source code"" should be a fragment of a runtime plugin. Especially with the new four part verioning scheme, seems the source fragment could be clearly marked to go with some exaxt verion of the plugin, instead of relying on features to pair them up.",2006-06-27 04:13 EDT by David Williams    ,2008-06-06 17:42 EDT       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/internal/tests/SourceTests.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/ModelBuildScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/ModelBuildScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/compatibility/Feature.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/compatibility/FeatureParser.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/PDEState.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/Utils.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/ModelBuildScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/BuildTimeFeature.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/IBuildPropertiesConstants.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/IXMLConstants.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/ModelBuildScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/internal/tests/SourceTests.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/Messages.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/Utils.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/BuildDirector.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/BuildTimeFeature.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/BuildTimeFeatureFactory.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/BuildTimeFeatureParser.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/compatibility/Feature.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/compatibility/FeatureEntry.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/compatibility/FeatureParser.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src_ant/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/tasks/BuildScriptGeneratorTask.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/IPDEBuildConstants.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/IXMLConstants.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/Utils.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/ModelBuildScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/SourceGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/PDEState.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/compatibility/Feature.java

I was quite surprised to find some of our compile logs (and their occasional error) was not being ""gathered up"" and posted to our drop site.

Ideally, in the wst feature, we'd only have to list the xml.ui feature.  And, everything (else) about the build seems to work find doing it that way.   But, we've found we need to explicitly list the xml.core feature, in the high level wst feature, even though that seems redundant and should be unnecessary.

162020,Feature qualifier suffix algorithm problems,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"This bug covers several defects in the algorithm for computing the feature qualifier suffix.  These defects are grouped together because it is extremely likely that they will all be fixed at the same time.   (1) Certain increases in the qualifier of a plugin can result in a decrease of the qualifier suffix for the feature.  To trigger the bug, there has to be a slight increase in one digit of the plugin's qualifier and a large decrease in the subsequent digit.  For example, take a feature containing one plugin.  The following plugin version numbers result in the following qualifier suffixes: 1.2.3.aaa-0z-aaa -> ------ooo-3B-ooo 1.2.3.aaa-10-aaa -> ------ooo-32-ooo The qualifier suffix decreased ('B' -> '2') even though the plugin version increased ('0' -> '1').   (2) The qualifier suffix can decrease from one build to the next if the longest qualifier among the plugins gets shorter, even if that qualifier increases in value.  For example, take a feature containing two plugins.  The following plugin version number pairs result in the following qualifier suffixes: 4.5.6.xyz, 1.2.3.abccccc -> --------1022qqqq 4.5.6.xyz, 1.2.3.abcd    -> -----------1022r The qualifier suffix decreased ('1' -> '-') even though the plugin version increased ('c' -> 'd').   (3) The qualifier suffix will remain unchanged if some '-' characters are appended to the qualifier of a plugin, where the plugin qualifier in question is not the longest qualifier of all the plugins in the feature.  For example, take a feature containing two plugins.  The following plugin version number pairs result in the following qualifier suffixes: 1.2.3.abcdefg, 4.5.6.xyz   -> --------1022rstu 1.2.3.abcdefg, 4.5.6.xyz-- -> --------1022rstu The qualifier suffix was unchanged even though the plugin version increased (blank -> '-').",2006-10-23 17:59 EDT by David Olsen    ,2007-02-01 11:53 EST       (History)     ,
162075,Product configuration launcher arguments section does not support space,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"I was originally to file this under PDE/UI, but in fact, the underlying processing of the launcher arguments still doesn't allow anybody to use arguments in launcher configurations that have spaces. See the ticket where I originally entered a discussion on, ticket #88766:  -  Alex, the eclipse.ini file cannot possibly come out ok if your usage is the following: ""My product is called 'My Application' and I want to use the -name feature of the eclipse launcher to set that""  In the product editor, since no documentation says otherwise, naively you would enter in the launcher argument multi-line text:  -name My Application  This however causes the ini to have three lines. Next step, you think ""I guess I should have quoted the app name so they dont cut it up"":  -name ""My Application""  which, since the quotes aren't processed, just gets you:  -name ""My Application""  in the ini file (which then gives a command line of  ""-name"" """"My"" ""Application"""")  Finally, if you try Alex's last example, say:  >   <launcherArgs> >      <programArgs>-name >hello there world</programArgs> >   </launcherArgs> > >where ""-name"" and ""hello there world"" were put on 2 separate lines in the >product editor.    As alex points out, that still doesn't work:  >However, when exporting, the eclipse.ini looks like: >-name >hello >there >world  instead of -name hello there world  At least, that's my understanding of Eddie's situation.   In Summary:  The *BUG* is very simple: there is NO WAY to use a space in ANY ARGUMENT in ANY LAUNCHER built via PDE.    I see the culprit: the use of StringTokenizer to process the launcher arguments, without offering any space-escape syntax.",2006-10-24 09:21 EDT by Eddie Galvez    ,2008-11-28 12:54 EST       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/ProductGenerator.java

168079,Support for qualifier substitution within a string,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Currently users are able to specify a bundle version of 1.0.0.qualifier and have the qualifier automatically filled in at build time.  This is a request to enhance this feature and allow for string substitution for users to append a qualifier to a partial string. For instance - 1.0.0.1_qualifier.  In our specific case, we are putting third-party bundles into Orbit and we would like to maintain their current version number. We like the addition of the qualifier because it allows for updates but some libraries already have 4 parts to their version so this mechanism would allow the qualifier to be appended to the already existing 4 part version.

174107,VM Args not getting copied from .product to ini file in Mac build,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Build ID: M20060921-0945  Steps To Reproduce: 1. Extract the attached file, mac-ini-copy-bug.tgz 2. Import the resulting project into eclipse. 3. Choose File->Export...->Eclipse product, and export as a MacOS x86 product, and possibly in one other configuration for reference. 4. Start the application on MacOS and the window title will be ""Missing property"", start it on any other platform (we used linux.gtk.x86), and the window title will be ""Property: my_application_window_title"".  More information: The attached project is based on the ""Hello RCP"" template project.  It simply reads a Java system property by calling 'System.getProperty(""mac.ini.copy.bug.property"")', and uses the resulting value to set the title of the application window.  The system property should be passed into the runtime by a line that looks something like '-Dmac.ini.copy.bug.property=...'  that should live in <launcher>.ini, in this case macinicopybug.ini.  Note that the application window title should be the same on all platforms, but it is incorrect on the Mac.  This works perfectly in the Linux build, for example, but in the MacOS build, the file located at macinicopybug.app/Contents/MacOS/macinicopybug.ini contains no trace of this argument.  In digging around in the build system, we found that BrandingIron.java (in the org.eclipse.pde.build plugin) seems to copy a standard .ini file into place, possibly overwriting the one containing custom arguments (take a look at BrandingIron.copyMacIni(...).   We first noticed this bug as part of our automated build system that uses the ant-based PDE build.

However, when the Jar file is opened as stream and the framework tries to get the manifest, it will fail.

For some reason my cvs client was having issues downloading anything when launched as part of the fetch task (the error finally was ""get_cvs_port_number called for invalid connection method"" which seems to be *really* rare).   Anyway, I started debugging the build and saw that as part of the fetch task there's a retrieve.xml created to get the feature.xml and its build.properties. The problem is this retrieve.xml is temporary and it contains two cvs tasks and two move tasks. This died quietly because of my cvs problem and moved on to parsing the feature.xml which wasn't there which then threw an exception telling me to check my maps files (which had no problems). I'd suggest turning on failonerror=true on all of the tasks inside of the retrieve.xml so that it'll throw an Exception to the AntRunner and it'll stop there.

Unfortunately, at that point there are no error logs neither in the target directory nor in the current workspace. This is especially confusing, since q_1.0.0 was being built and it was  definitely there. So were its (direct) dependencies.  When debugging the PDE I found as the real cause that r could not be resolved because its requirement p[1,2) was not met - actually p_1 was also present but could still not be found, I guess due to some shadowing by p_2.

182566,Problems when exporting projects with same last segment,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Build ID: M20070212-1330  Steps To Reproduce: 1. Extract the attached 'ExportTestPlugin.zip' file to an arbitrary directory outside the eclipse workspace directory. 2. Import the ExportTest plugin (ExportTest/trunk directory) via Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace (do not copy the projects to the workspace!). 3. Import the ExportTestView plugin (ExportView/trunk directory) via Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace (do not copy the projects to the workspace!). 4. Open the Overview tab of the product description and configuration dialog of the ExportTest product (ExportTest.product). 5. Launch the product. -> The product should run without any errors. 6. Export the product via the 'Eclipse Product export wizard' to a directory (Destination = Directory) outside the workspace ('Synchronize before exporting' is checked). The export should terminate without any errors. 7. Try to run the exported product by executing the exe-file. This should fail, a log file should be created. 8. Inspect the two jars ExportTest_1.0.0.jar and ExportTestView_1.0.0.jar. Both ExportTest_1.0.0.jar and ExportTestView_1.0.0.jar contains the classes of the ExportTestView plugin.  More information: The product export wizard offered on the overview page of the product description and configuration dialog of a .product-file generates faulty plugin jars under some circumstances: For each plugin an appropriate jar file is created but all the jars contain the packages and classes of one single plugin. The steps described above demonstrate this issue.      In detail: The plugins 'ExportTest' and 'ExportTestView' are located outside the workspace.  Both are imported via 'Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace' with unchecked 'Copy projects to workspace' option.   Executing the product (ExportTest -> ExportTest.product -> Overview -> Testing -> Launch the product) within the eclipse ide succeeds. No problems occur.   But the product export fails:  I exported the product to a directory via the Eclipse Product export wizard offered on the overview  page of the product description and configuration dialog (i. e. editor) of the ExportTest/ExportTest.product file.   The export process terminates without any errors, but starting the product  via the generated exe-file fails. The log reports that the activator of the bundle to execute is invalid and  cannot be found respectively. A ClassNotFoundException is thrown.   Inspecting the 'plugins' subdirectory created during the export process shows  that indeed for every plugin the product consists of, an appropriate jar archive was created  but with wrong content:  Instead of containing all the classes and packages that make up the related plugins  all the jar archives consist of classes and packages of one single plugin (In this case of plugin ExportTestView).  Only the manifest.mf files, the plugin.xml files, the referenced libraries and other files marked for export in the build.properties files are exported correctly to the corresponding archives.   That's why the required activator cannot be found: It isn't exported to the jar file so far.   Exporting each plugin separately via Export... -> Plug-in Development -> Deployable plug-ins and fragments  with checked ""Package plug-ins as individual JAR archives"" option leads to the expected result.  But if more than one plugin are exported this way at the same time  (i. e. both plugins are checked within the Export deployable plug-ins and fragments wizard page)  the problem occurs again.   If step 2 and step 3 are swaped then everything (export and execution) works fine.    The same holds if the projects are imported via 'Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace' a second time (into newly created workspace) but this time with checked option 'Copy projects into workspace'.",2007-04-16 11:23 EDT by ml4    ,2007-04-24 10:00 EDT       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/ClasspathComputer3_0.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/ModelBuildScriptGenerator.java

186437,Problems compiling against minimum execution environments,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"build 3.3 m7  If we have a bundle which requires a Foundation 1.0 Execution Environment and also uses XML APIs (available from the JRE as of 1.4), technically the bundle manifest should contain the Foundation 1.0 EE and the correct XML imports. Then when we are building, as long as the XML APIs are provided by another bundle, everything should work fine.  But for now we have been requiring people to put both 1.4 and Foundation 1.0 on their list of EEs (with 1.4 first) so 1.4 is picked up as being the first EE and we use those class libraries to compile against.  We recently came across a similar problem with the Equinox Incubator JMX bundles and their javax.management related imports.  Tom and I have been looking at this problem and it looks like it is related to the EE that is being passed into the resolver in the platform properties. PDE/Build is passing a platform properties which has the EE set to 1.6...the highest version of class libraries that we use to compile.   In the State when we are figuring out what packages the system bundle provides, we take the union of the ones exported from the OSGi bundle and those provided by the class libraries. So when it comes time to resolve the bundles requiring XML, (in the case where we don't have 1.4 set as the EE) we think that we are going to get the XML APIs from the OSGi bundle and that isn't true and fails when it comes time to compile.  The fix seems to be that in PDE/Build we need to pass in multiple platform properties, one for each EE that is available so we can match against more than just one EE.  I will attach a partial patch which Tom provided which sets up a platform properties and then clones it, once for each EE. Its definatly a step in the right direction, thanks Tom!",2007-05-10 15:02 EDT by DJ Houghton    ,2009-07-14 11:10 EDT       (History)     ,

Starting in M3 we should merge some of these changes back into HEAD.  The following changes will be made: 1) Remove dependency on update.core for the Site and Feature models.  In the future, pde.build will likely move to depend on org.eclipse.equinox.prov.metadata.generator (or equivalent), in the meantime, some classes have been cloned in org.eclipse.pde.internal.build.site.compatibility. (These changes still include a dependency on update.core for the JarProcessor, which will be moving to org.eclipse.equinox.p2.jarprocessor).  2) Refactor FeatureBuildScriptGenerator. (a) Move Source feature/plugin generation into its own class: SourceGenerator.  This will make it easier to address things like bug 148782, bug 130127, bug 197188  (b) Move ""build orchestration"" out of FeatureBuildScriptGenerator.  Have FeatureBuildScriptGenerator only responsible for generating the build script for a feature.  All other build orchestration type activities are moved into a new class BuildDirector.

When you build, the archive will be a zip instead of a folder.   More information:  I debugged into it and found that the reason it doesn't work is because the configuration passed into BuildScriptGenerator.realSetArchivesFormat() is always (group, group, group), which doesn't match any of my real configs.    So, I tried setting the archiveFormat to group,group,group.  This didn't work either because it checks to see if it's a valid config before adding it to the archivesFormat table.  Then I tried adding group,group,group as a config as well but I got a message saying something about duplicate root_files.  Finally, I made a patch allowing an archiveFormat of group,group,group if groupConfigurations is true.  That works fine, though I don't know if that's the approach you'd like to take.  If you use the patch, you need to be sure to add a comment in the build.properties about needing to specify group,group,group as an archivesFormat if groupConfigurations=true.",2007-11-30 11:07 EST by kate_glickman    ,2007-12-04 11:41 EST       (History)     ,

We propose removing them in favour of the Ant tasks (that have been tested and  are the ones used in our builds).

Because HashSet is used to collect features/plugins/root providers from all configs, the relative ordering gets lost. Using LinkedHashSet instead preserves this ordering and results in the correct assemble script.",2008-01-04 11:41 EST by Peter Nehrer    ,2008-01-10 11:30 EST       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/AssembleScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/AssemblyInformation.java

On line 389 of AbstractScriptGenerator the method loadProduct returns a product file of  new ProductFile(f.getAbsolutePath(), null)  i.e, no OS is specified and so the getIcons method of the ProductFile will return an empty string array.  This product file is later used by AssembleConfigScriptGenerator in computeIconsList() where it does a productFile.getIcons expecting some results and when it doesn't find any it simply returns ""${launcherIcons}"" which is then all that is inserted into the generated eclipse.brand call in the assemble.*.xml files like this:  <eclipse.brand   root=""${eclipse.base}/win32.win32.x86/${collectingFolder}""   icons=""${launcherIcons}""   name=""${launcherName}""   os=""${os}""        />  If I write a little unit test that contructs a new ProductFile from my RCP applications .product, it will correctly pass my icon lists back so long as I have listed an OS in the constructor.

The IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.Magic is set to 0x20b instead of 0x10b on a x64 .exe file.  In the very short term we might want to throw a better error and exit IconExe gracefully in the case of encountering a x64 .exe rather than simply returning null from IconExe.getIcons which results in the null pointer exception during branding.  The branding process could then also skip x64 executables rather than falling over completely leaving the end user to find their own way to brand the launcher but allowing all other platforms (including win32_x86) to go through unscathed.

243582,Support embedding repository information in released bundles,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"This request is somehow cross-component and not PDE only, so I'm adding few people on CC for initial discussion.  When getting a bug report that should be simple to fix, I'm often trying to find a way how the reporter could try fix the issue himself and come up with a patch. The two biggest obstacles explaining what he needs to do, are   (1) How to obtain the correct sources, and   (2) How to create a patch (preferably against HEAD).  Given that the reporter apparently has some version of Eclipse up and running, he can easily import bundles from his running Eclipse into a workspace. If he has SDK installed, he can even import with source. While having the correct source for the actual runtime is great to debug, such imported bundles often don't build properly; plus, it's hard to find the correct bundle in the CVS or SVN Repository that matches the imported source.  I propose that     (1) Released binary bundles get Repository information added to their       Manifest:       Repository type, root, module  and maptag -- basically exactly the       information that currently is in the Mapfile.    (2) Importing bundles into the Workspace gets an additional 4th Option,       ""Import with Source from Repository"" which uses the known Repository       type, root, module and maptag in order to import from that Repository.  Now in most cases, it should be possible to build the bundle and much easier to create a patch. Plus, after patching against the released Maptag first, the submitter can even merge the patch onto HEAD himself just by doing Team > Switch to another branch or version.  I'd suspect that this enhancement makes it easier to get community fixes for simple things, and take some unnecessary workload off committers.  I'm actually assigning this request PDE-build first, assuming that once the Repository information is in the bundles, the 2nd step of leveraging it for the import could be a separate bug.

The workaround I'm using right now seems to prove my theory below, but I'd like you guys to confirm before I create a bugzilla.  Using 3.4 I'm exporting a product into a p2 repository, using qualifiers in the bundle versions to generate more recent versions whenever a build is finished. Now, when trying to update myself during the initial run of my product the Query looking for updates does find them correctly but the ProvisioningPlan never returns ""isOK"". Looking at content.xml I found out that the group, generated from the product, has the version ""1.0.0"" just like my product-definition indicates. The inclusion rules of that group are very strict so that updates are only possible for the entire group, which is fine in this scenario so I went ahead and changed the version of the product to '1.0.0.qualifier'. However, looking at the repository the qualifier never got translated and was put as-is into content.xml.   Long story short, my release-script replaces ""qualifier"" with a real qualifier now and things start to work... There is two solutions I can see here: - Change the group definitions to have a wider VersionRange so that individual plug-ins may be updated or - Allow for qualifiers in the product version to support updating the product along with the changed bundle.  Maybe I'm not seeing the obvious solution here, please advise !:)   2.) Response from Pascal: Hi Helmut,  This is a well-known problem. Please open a bug against PDE Build.

250942,Incorrect character ordering in feature qualifier,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"When comparing version numbers to determine which one is greater, Eclipse does a simple string compare when looking at the qualifier part of the version number.  (See org.osgi.framework.Version.compareTo() in plugin org.eclipse.osgi.)  In that ordering, an underscore is in between the capital letters and the lower case letters, i.e. 'Z' < '_' < 'a'.  But when creating the feature qualifier suffix (that hash-like string at the end of a feature's version number), the underscore character is treated as if it were between the digits and the capital letters, i.e. '9' < '_' < 'A'.  (See org.eclipse.pde.internal.build.Utils.BASE_64_ENCODING and how it is used in plugin org.eclipse.pde.build.)  This bug can result in feature version numbers that go backwards when plugin version numbers are increased correctly.  That can result in the update manager refusing to install the newer build of a feature because it thinks the newer build has a lower version than what is already installed.  As a specific example, someone at our company changed a plugin version number from 7.2.0.v20081013 to 7.2.0.v20081014.

252711,build script generator fails to resolve older plugin,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Build ID: M20080911-1700  When running a build in headless mode, I observed the case that a feature's build.xml was generated with an empty all.plugins target. The (single) plugin that should have been mentioned here also exists in the platform running the build, where (accidentally in this case) the source version was less than the one from the build platform. After fixing the version number, everything went fine. Should mention that the feature.xml specifies the exact plugin version.  I am wondering whether this implies that pde build will not be able to use a newer eclipse to build a maintenance release with lesser version numbers?  At first sight this issue reminded me of bug 234178, but this impression might be completely wrong.  Given that the target's start and end tags where written correctly and looking at FeatureBuildScriptGenerator#generateAllPluginsTarget() the contained loop neither produced any result nor threw an exception. I had to stop analysing there because I couldn't easily see how to run a headless build in the debugger. Can the script generator(s) be invoked separately using eclipse command line arguments?  Wait: what's in getSite(false).getRegistry().getSortedBundles()? Is that all available versions or only the newest version of each bundle?

The generated manifest.mf file is wrong   Also the eclipse process is keeping a lock of the generated plug-in jar. This indicates that where the jar file is opened, the close of it is not in a finally block (which it should be).   Test 2) Use the Export -> Deployable plug-ins and fragments menu item to export the plug-in.   Similar to test 1, the generated manifest is wrong.  This problem also exists in 35M4.

We're generating an RCP product into P2 metadata. The Product contains our own feature and the org.eclipse.platform feature 2. We then use the p2 director to generate a product from the P2 metadata 3. After running the generated product, we install a separate feature using P2. 4. The config.ini is written over, with the osgi.bundles property getting set tot he new plugins, rather than retaining the reference to the simpleconfigurator plugin.    More information: I noticed the config.ini was marked as written by EquinoxFwConfigFileParser. When I placed breakpoints in that class and debugged the feature installation remotely, I see that during some touchpoint actions it reads and then saves the configuration. The problem is that it appears to be using some bad hardcoded values for LauncherData that refer to the eclipse launcher. We've changed the launcher name in our product to be ""AptanaStudio"".  If we specify a different osgi.configuration.area in our config.ini, then we don;t appear to experience this issue.

More information: We have a XULRunner plugin to offer up a ""Firefox-like"" internal browser in Eclipse. It has a number of fragments and plugins that are platform/OS specific. On those plugins that have two values for any one of the attributes (say os being macosx or win32, or arch being x86 or x86_64), the plugins don't get installed. My best guess is because the metadata generated has an invalid filter syntax generated from this.  The generated filter is something like ""(& (os=macosx,win32))"".

We override the publisher action to load the manifest and we associate it with the first element of the File[] that is passed in.  We would be more robust to remember the bundle location for ourselves and ignore the passed in File [].  2) publisher, BundlesAction#expandLocations stops recursing when it hits a bundle, but it doesn't handle old-style bundles without manifests, we end up recursing and adding all the plugin's files are locations.  (2) confuses (1), and we end up publishing a regular file as if it were a jar.   I will fix the publisher to stop recursing if there is a plugin.xml or a fragment.xml.

The chmod action can fail if the file doesn't exist.  Generally, PDE/Build checks that the file exists by selecting the files to chmod out of the set that are being included in the archive.  However, when doing this selection, if absolute: root properties targeted at a folder are used, we can incorrectly include chmods that don't exist. eg: root.permissions.755 = eclipse root.macosx.cocoa.x86.folder.Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS=absolute:file:/foo/bar/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse  The second property places the /foo/bar/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse file under the directory Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS.  It is this eclipse file that is being incorrectly selected as a match for the permissions property.   This also has the affect of incorrectly excluding a permission that would have been correct root.macosx.cocoa.x86.permissions.755=Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse",2009-04-28 19:17 EDT by Andrew Niefer    ,2009-05-08 19:37 EDT       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/internal/tests/p2/PublishingTests.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src_ant/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/publisher/GatherFeatureTask.java

I'm using the default values for a new product file, so it's a plugin-based product.    One thing I should mention - this is a bundle line-up that does not include simpleconfigurator, so I'm looking at the osgi.bundles property in config.ini.  If I add simpleconfigurator (and prereqs) to my line-up, then bundles.list does get populated correctly and the product runs just fine.  To reproduce:  1. New workspace 2. Configured my target to point to only 3.5M7 equinox-sdk and delta-pack bundles.  3. New generic project containing new product file. 4. Leave Product and Application values unset. 5. On Dependencies tab, add org.eclipse.equinox.http bundle, Add Required Plug-ins,should have 5 in the list. 6. On Configuration tab, add http bundle.  Set auto-start to true (see **** below)  7. On Launching tab, add ""-console"" to Program Arguments, add ""-Dosgi.noShutdown=true -Declipse.ignoreApp=true"" to VM args.  Also used ""Bug273961"" as the launcher name. 8. Export product (I have ""sync"" and ""generate metadata"" turned off), resulting config.ini has ""@0:start"" values for http bundle.  *** I just reported bug 274889, which prevented me from changing the auto-start value via the editor.  Please update that bug if you can or can't reproduce this issue too.  If you do run into the same issue, just open the .product file as a text file and change the start level there.  I get the same results with an existing product file that has several bundles enabled for auto-start at default start level.  I will also attach my product file here for reference.

From Bundle D make use of any public interface in package X that is different between versions 3.0.0 and 2.0.0. **IMPORTANT** If you notice Bundle D uses X[2.0.0] and *not* X[3.0.0] which is used by package B.  3.

The .java files are in src/, and there is a .settings file. Another thing is that the qualifier part in the bundle name is not replaced by a date string.  Since this is not a valid OSGi bundle, subsequent uses of the bundle fail. The export works just fine when using the ""Running platform"" as target platform.  I observed this issue only with junit4, but it may be applicable to other bundles as well.  A serious factor is that this corruption is silent, which is especially worrisome for automated builds.

126266,Enhancement Request: refactor customTargets.xml,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"In the default case, the only customization required to run PDE Build for customTargets.xml is to add individual ant calls for each feature in the ""allElements"" target and subsequently add the corresponding ""assemble"" targets for each feature.  1) With each release of Eclipse (or at least each update to milestones)    one has to check if any changes/improvements went into the    customTargets.xml template and then copy over the changes into your copy. 2) Due to the content and structure of customTargets.xml one cannot easily    dynamically inject the list of features to build and assemble. i.e.    Typically you would go off and add a feature in the IDE and then go over    and modify the customTargets.xml and add (at least) two sections for that    feature.  Suggestion: refactor the customTargets.xml template into two templates: customTargets.xml and allElements.xml. Have customTargets.xml's 'allElements' delegate to allElements.xml's 'allElementsDelegator'. The 'allElementsDelegator' is basically a copy of the original 'allElements' target. Include all the assemble targets in allElements.xml. Then use <import file=""${allElementsFile} /> to pull in all the targets from the allElements.xml into customTargets.xml.  Why? Now you only need to modify allElements.xml to add/remove features from the automated build, allowing isolation from possible changes to the customTargets.xml. But more importantly, you can generate allElements.xml based upon the features present in your features/ directory.  I have taken this approach and went one step further. When I generate my allElements.xml I identify all the features that have a specific property set in it's corresponding build.properties file to determine if the feature takes part in the headless build... i.e.) Headless-Build=<value>[,<value>] Simply creating a feature and setting this property would declare that it participates in a headless build (Providing a list of values permits filtering features for specific target types of headless builds)...  I'll attach the diff for customTargets.xml as well as allElements.xml for your perusal  Cheers,  John.",2006-02-02 16:20 EST by John Bossom    ,2006-02-13 17:34 EST       (History)     ,

Choose the template ""Hello, World Command"". - Edit the build.properties of the plug-in org.example.ui. For the source build, select at least src. - Create a new feature project named org.example and add org.example.ui. - Edit the file build.properties of the feature org.example and append the line ""generate.plugin@org.example.source = org.example"" - Edit the feature.xml file. Copy the plug-in element and have the feature also include org.example.source. - Create a folder somewhere with sub-folders plugins and features. Copy the entire org.example project into features and the entire org.example.ui project into plugins - Run the following command, with ${ECLIPSE} pointing to the actual Eclipse installation. java -jar ${ECLIPSE}/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.0.201.R35x_v20090715.jar \      -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner \      -buildfile ${ECLIPSE}/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.1.R35x_20090820/scripts/build.xml \      -Dbuilder=${ECLIPSE}/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.1.R35x_20090820/templates/headless-build \      -DtopLevelElementId=org.example \      -DbuildDirectory=${FOLDER_WITH_PLUGINS_AND_FEATURES_CREATED_BEFORE}      -Dbase=${ECLIPSE} \      -DbaseLocation=${ECLIPSE} \      -Dbaseos=macosx (or whatever) \      -Dbasews=cocoa (or whatever) \      -Dbasearch=x86 (or whatever) - Examine the plugin directory: It contains a folder org.example.source_<version> with the selected sources. - Examine the generated zip file: It contains the jar'ed source plug-in which in turn again contains the sources. - Copy the contents of the zip file to the dropins folder and re-start Eclipse with a different workspace. Verify that the sample command is present. - Create a new empty plug-in project.  - Add a dependency to org.example.ui. - Select Navigate --> Open Type and enter SampleHandler.  ---> Instead of the Java source, the class file editor appears. - Open the Plug-In Development Perspective.

301311,FetchScriptGenerator treats qualifier differently than rest of pde.build,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Created attachment 157679 [details] proposed patch  I recently migrated to using org.eclipse.team.svn.pde.build and its associated map-file format. One of our plugins has versions of this format: 1.2.3.XYZ_qualifier  For integration builds the map file specifies the tag to be used in qualifier substitution, so   plugin@my.plugin=SVN,url=http://my.url,tag=tags/builds/345,path=my/path should build the plugin in version 1.2.3.XYZ_345 (Extracting the last segment from tags/builds/345 is specific to the svn plugin).  In order for the rest of pde.build to correctly replace the qualifier with what's specified in the map file, the following entry is required in pluginVersions.properties:   my.plugin,1.2.3.XYZ=345 however, the FetchScriptGenerator creates this line:   my.plugin,1.2.3=345  Down the road this does not match the bundle symbolic name so the qualifier is replaced with the current date, instead of the specified tag ""345"".  I tried several other ways of specifying this in the map file but without success. Given that downstream the extended entry  in pluginVersions.properties is indeed handled as desired, I assume that it's just an omission in FetchScriptGenerator not to process the qualifier's prefix (""XYZ"").  I've prepared a patch that adds this behaviour and it has been successfully used in our build.   The one thing I haven't checked is, whether pde.build specifically tests for the separator '_' (in ""XYZ_345"") or whether any char before ""qualifier"" is treated as a separator. This is relevant in the version line     my.plugin,1.2.3.XYZ=345 which does not include the separator, so I know it is handled specifically somewhere, and saying     my.plugin,1.2.3.XYZ_=345 does NOT work.",2010-01-29 17:17 EST by Stephan Herrmann    ,2010-02-16 17:02 EST       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/internal/tests/ScriptGenerationTests.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/FetchScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/QualifierReplacer.java

303960,Ability to override javac task during pde builds,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"I posted this to the pde-dev mailing list and was asked to raise a bug, so here it is:  ---  I am trying to work on the pde export facilities of AJDT (aspectj tool support for Eclipse).  Currently, AJDT provides custom wizards for exporting plugins, features, and products, as well as headless build support.  The problem is that these wizards are essentially a copy of pde export wizards.  And this is difficult to maintain for each new release.  For the Helios release, I am considering a different approach for aspectj aware pde export and pde builds.  Essentially, the requirement is that the pde build happens as normal, except that the javac call should be replaced with a call to iajc (with a few extra options).  I've been playing around a bit and I am able to get this mostly working through a customBuildCallBack.xml script and adding some ant commands to the @dot.post.compile task.  In this task, I first delete the class files created by the javac call, and then I call the iajc task.  There are some problems, however:  1. This feels hacky.  The code is compiled twice and the results of the first compile is deleted. 2. The javac call will likely have some compile errors (expected because javac cannot compile the aspects).  These errors will be logged and can be confusing to users. 3. Source bundles will not include the *.aj files unless there is something added to the customBuildCallBack.xml script (I think...I haven't actually tried to fix this yet).  Note that I am having this problem with AspectJ-aware bundles, but I know this is also a problem for Groovy-aware bundles.  And I expect that scala-aware modules and any other Java-like language will have the same problem.  Any ideas on a more graceful solution to the porblem?

306818,Improve license support in p2.,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"A license is typically a named artifact with a version. p2 is very good at handling such artifacts and have IU's express requirements on them. Instead of using this, licenses are inlined in the IU. This leads to problems since there are many variants with minor, often unintended differences (see bug 306627 for examples).  I think a license like EPL 1.0 should be provided by an IU and that other IU's that use this license should express that using a requirement rather then in-lining the license. This vouches for one occurrence of the license and one occurrence of each translation of that license. Not only would that fix the issue with minor variations, it would also speed up the parsing of content.xml and also make it smaller.  Ideally, the tooling mechanisms for this should be designed in such a way that it can be used for copyrights as well since that too is a special thing in an IU. It's not uncommon that a vendor uses the same copyright for all things.",2010-03-23 09:37 EDT by Thomas Hallgren    ,2010-12-06 13:20 EST       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/internal/tests/FetchTests.java org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/internal/tests/p2/LicenseTests.java org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/tests/PDEBuildTestSuite.java org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/tests/PDETestCase.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/FetchScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/IPDEBuildConstants.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/Messages.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/FeatureBuildScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/compatibility/Feature.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/compatibility/FeatureParser.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src_ant/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/publisher/GatherFeatureTask.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src_ant/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/tasks/LicenseReplaceTask.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src_ant/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/tasks/TaskMessages.java

I understand why it has been mirrored, but my question is regarding the fact that it has been mirrored as a folder.  In fact, it has been mirrored from my Eclipse Install which has it as a folder since it has been “Installed/Provisioned”.  So the build is mirroring an “Installed” artifact to an IU in its original format (folder in this case).  And having folders in a consumable p2 repo could lead to the following issue when mirroring or provisioning thru http:        Installation failed.        [exec] An error occurred while collecting items to be installed        [exec]  session context was:(profile=TargetRuntime, phase=org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.engine.phases.Collect, operand=, action=).

Question 1)   - Should the mirror operation in the build be modified so it always output to a defined target p2 repo format (in this case, jar)?  Or is there a way to do it already? Or is there something that should be done differently?     Question 2)   - Would it make sense to allow support of all <slicingOptions> in the above p2.mirror task from the build?  That way, the output p2 repo could avoid including optional dependencies (if not wanted).  Currently, it seems to only support includeNonGreedy=""false"" (hardcoded in /org.eclipse.pde.build/pdebuildsrc/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/P2ConfigScriptGenerator.java line 303).    Steps to reproduce: - Create a new Workspace - Create a simple dummy bundle (bundle_b) which only has 1 simple Import-Package: org.apache.tools.ant;resolution:=optional - Create a generic project ""p2.mirror.investigation""     o Under that project, create a simple dummy product (product_p) which only includes the bundle_b in his list of plugins.     o Under that same project, copy the attached build.properties and p2.mirror.investigation.xml - Run the p2.mirror.investigation.xml script (using Eclipse's Ant Runner) - You'll find the results under p2.test.mirror.problem.out fodler.

This leads to problems later when trying to install the product because we don't have metadata for the correct version.   Also need to investigate why these aren't the same bundle.

329162,auto generate source bundles,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Created attachment 182115 [details] patch to generate source bundles  It is often interesting to have the build output source. PDE UI supports this by generating source feature declarations with all the right markup.  PDE Build however does not have an option to ""get source with that"".  Attached here is a patch that provides two PDE Build switches: generateUberSourceFeature and includeAllSource. (naming is preliminary).  generateUberSourceFeature (boolean): if true it tells PDE build to create an uber source feature that references source bundles for the things being built.  There is no attempt to create a source feature structure that matches the runtime feature structure.  The goal here is to simply get the source bundles generated and into the resultant repository.  This coupled with the new PDE UI ""would you like source with that"" capability in target management (see bug 328929), allows people to easily create SDKs for their features and products.  includeAllSource (boolean): refines what the uber source feature contains. if false, only source for things actually being compiled is generated and published.  If this flag is true, all possible known source is included.  This latter setting allows for the creation of complete SDKs from existing SDKs.  This patch (against head) is a prototype to show the idea and gauge interest.  It has been tested in a couple of PDE UI export work flows without using PDE UI's source generation facilities and works as described.   Topics: - The output of such a build includes an additional feature (the uber source feature).  This feature is not really intended for explicit use rather it is an unwanted artifact of the process.  Need to figure out how to stop its generation/inclusion  - Flag naming.  ""ubersourcefeature"" is very implementation-y.  Need a better name that speaks to users.  - The implementation relies on a hack/convention whereby source bundles end in .source.  This is indeed the case for our stuff but is kinda hacky.  It would be better to have a more explicit way of telling source bundles from others.  The manifest has this information for built bundles and for things that we are building we should know that it is an auto-generated source bundle.  We just need to track this info.  - PDE UI integration.  Once this behaviour is nailed down we should look at how PDE UI integrates with this.  Currently they have their own mechanism for exporting with source.  Perhaps that can be simplified in favor of support in PDE Build?  - As an enhancement, we should also be able to enable excluding things from the uber source feature.  Perhaps using regex or ant patterns or something trivially simple.  A workaround for folks that really care is to ensure that source they don't want included is not present in the target/base.  But that forces them into more management of complex data sets when a simple set of patterns would do the trick.  - This patch introduces two booleans but not all four combinations are valid.  It may be better (less error prone) for users if there was just one setting (eg., ""autoSourceGenerationMode"") with value like NONE, ALL, COMPILED  - Given the goal of this enhancement (to get the source bundles in the output repo) it may be good to tie its enablement to whether or not we are creating a repo (whatever that means).",2010-10-31 12:24 EDT by Jeff McAffer    ,2011-03-08 09:42 EST       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/build/internal/tests/p2/PublishingTests.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/BuildScriptGenerator.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src_ant/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/tasks/BuildScriptGeneratorTask.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/AssemblyInformation.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/AbstractScriptGenerator.java

552647,Cannot suspend nor stop gdb,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"I'm working on a Eclipse Plugin project, previously developed under Eclipse 4.3 (the genereated product, including debugger was fully functional). Now I have to export the same Eclipse Product under Eclipse 4.11. I know that there is no CDI interface now, substituted by DSF. I do it both for Linux and Windows. The product exported under Ubuntu 18.04 was tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine and on Linux Mint desktop. It works perfectly. Now my problem is, that if I export the same product on Windows 10 and run it on any Windows 10 desktop or virtual machine, even the same as used for export, the effect is the same: I can run the debugger, but after I press the run button, I cannot suspend nor stop the debugger. The suspend and stop buttons are active and become greyed out after I press them, but nothing happens. The only thing I am able to do is to right click and disconnect all. One of the most important things for me is to be able to suspend and see where did the app hang while debugging.  Now comming to details:  -I use dedicated gdb developed under GDB 5.4.0 -I use Java 9.0.4 (older, but free) -I use Eclipse 2019.3 for Eclipse Committers with CDT tools plugin installed  I think it may be connected with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=304096#c54.

The opcode means (10003) that operation is not supported. The line appers after I press the suspend button.

Now create a plugin jar file  and install the plugin into the Eclipse plugins directory. Relaunch Eclipse so  the new plugin is read in; there should now be a new menu item to run Hello  World. When the plugin is activate you will see that rather than the clean  report of the assertion there is now an exception as I noted above. Now create  a new launch definition and select to use Hello.jar from the ""External Plug- ins"" list and make sure it is deselected from the ""Workspace Plug-ins"" list.

All or most of these derived zips consist in a simple repackaging of existing  things.  Because of this last property and the pain that represents the hand crafting of  such scripts, we decided to create an assembler / packager which goal is to  create assemble scripts.   The parameters for this assembler are a list of paths (directories or zips)  configurations and a feature to build.

The PDE even does an exceptional job at combining option files to  make the build.xml scripts to construct the deliverable artefacts.  I am  however having some problems getting the generated XML exactly how I like it.   Specifically within the javac task I want to set the failonerror to true.  <target name=""example.jar"" depends=""init""> <property name=""destdir"" value=""${temp.folder}/example.jar.bin""/> 	<delete dir=""${temp.folder}/example.jar.bin""/> 	<mkdir dir=""${temp.folder}/example.jar.bin""/> 	<!-- compile the source code --> 	<javac destdir=""${temp.folder}/example.jar.bin"" failonerror=""false""  verbose=""true"" debug=""on"" includeAntRuntime=""no""  bootclasspath=""${bootclasspath}"" classpath=""F:/eclipse/plugins/ ..... .jar""> 		<src path=""java/""/> 	</javac> 	.... 	.... 	</target>  This is what gets automatically generated by the PDE when I select 'create  plugin jars'.  We work in a team setting and have a separate box perform the  builds nightly by running the generated build.xml files.  If each user remember  to go in and fix the failonerror=true then everything is fine.  Every time the  project structure is slightly modified, the simplest way to correct the XML is  to simply re-generate it and the setting ends up back as false. All flags should use some kind of variable subsitution including the  classpath.  This is the one I found the most bizzare.  The .classpath file uses  variables, but when build.xml is created, all of the variables are resolved  into hard paths.

He knows of your request but you might want to send him mail or log a PR  just so it doesn't get lost.  /brian      klicnik@ca.ibm.com 12/14/01 12:56 PM            To:     Brian_Young@oti.com         cc:          Subject:        build manifest   Brian, I have just ""discovered"" (thanks to JW) the build.manifest you are  writing out and I would like to use it for self-hosting using the install/  update support ... it contains 99% of the information I was struggling to  get somehow.   The other 1% is a change request ....   Could you write out the build designation as a property so I can read it.  Currently it is written as a comment and the Java properties support  strips this off. I would like the 3 parts of the designator written out as  3 separate properties so I don't have to rely on the format of the string.  Ie. something like   build.type=I (or N or whatever other types you support)  build.id=20011206 (or whatever format you choose to use)  build.qualifier=20011206 (I actually don't understand what the second  stamp means, but whatever format you have is OK. Assume this is used to  spin failed builds).   This would allow me to do what I need. Let me know if you can do this.",2001-12-19 12:36 EST by Vlad Klicnik    ,2002-03-04 15:05 EST       (History)     ,

96552,[doc] Need to describe how to ship plugins as jars,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"I want to export a library plugin as a jar without nested jars.  If I use the normal convention of bin and src sub-dirs within the project, this seems impossible.  The only way I could get this to work is if the project root is also source and output root.  However, it is then difficult to eclude or include .java src files at will in the exported plugin.  Since NOT nesting jars is more efficient for jar-ed plugins, there should be better support for creating such.  Some things which would be rather easy in plain ant build.xml are simply impossible using the PDE.  For example, file patterns for what to include in the output plugin jar.  Also, the ability to add a subtree of project dir with a different path prefix within the resulting plugin jar  Potential problems / issues:  1) a way to use separate source and output dirs within a project while still supporting the creation of a plugin jar without nested jars.  Currently I cannot seem to avoid ""bin/com/..../foo.class"" as the path within the plugin jar. 2) This might be implemented by allowing bin (or other) includes to specify a custom prefix path within the output jar. 3) Allow ant-style (and/or regex) filtering for build includes.  Maybe I want everything in a subtree to wind up in the output, EXCEPT for a few file patterns 4) Make more of this the default.

Adjust the build.properties of this plugin to include the copied icon folder. 3. Rename the plugin project B such that the folder project name is different from the bundle symbolic name 4. create a product conf file for plugin a, adda name, product id (create new product id),select the right application, and update the launcher tab such that the launcher icon for win32 comes from the plugin.b icons folder  5. export product using the PDE ui. verify that the launcher icon has been proerply customized. (ie is greenish looking)  6. setup a simepl pde build envt for that product (see attached releng using a properly patched buildProduc.xml script and sample build.properties). The built product icon is still the standard eclipse icon, not the greensish customized icon.  The workaround is simple: the plugin b projectname and folder should match the bundle id. However this can be confusing at times, since when the export is triggered rom the UI, the lookup is done properly . Both the PDE UI export AND the PDE healess build should have the same behavior.

27464,[build] PDE Build only supports building 'in-place',RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"PDE Build Ant scripts have a hard-coded dependency on building plug-ins,  fragments and features 'in-place'. In other words, they expect that targets to  build are in a raw of directories, that each plugin/fragment/feature directory  contains a script and that source code is also in these directories.  When build is to be used in the workspace, this causes problems.  All the generated libraries and build artifacts are created in development  projects, immediately causing Team to create 'Not in version control' info  tasks.  PDE team tried to modify the way scripts are created by adding support for  alternative build script location. However, we now realize that it was just the  tip of the iceberg :-). The generated scripts themselves make assumptions about  their position and position of child scripts (in case of features) relative to  themselves.  Ideally, scripts would be configurable so that they would be able to accept non- default locations. For example, in our Update Site builder, we have a separate  Update Site project that has a folder devoted to building artifacts. We wanted  to create scripts there, run them indirectly (so that temp.folder is created  there as well) and redirect plugin and feature output into the  dedicated 'plugins' and 'features' folder in the site. At the moment, we cannot  because feature scripts make assumptions about the locations of the plugin  scripts, and plugin scripts think they are in plugin root directories.  Conclusion: plugin and feature Ant scripts should be configurable so that it is  possible to place build scripts and run them outside of the plugin/feature  directories. The goal is to only reference plugins and features and redirect  all the generated files and folders elsewhere.",2002-11-30 23:55 EST by Dejan Glozic    ,2004-04-12 17:12 EDT       (History)     ,

Run ANT on  the file.  It should work fine.  4)  Select feature.xml for feature bFeature and generate ANT build file.   Notice it also generates a new build.xml in plugin b.  Run ANT on the file in  plugin b.  It fails: ""[javac] Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details."" If you compare the different build.xml files generated in plugin b you'll  notice that the one that works includes ../a/bin on the classpath while the  failed one does not.  I'm guessing that it expects that plugin a has already  been built.  I don't want to have to make aFeature an included feature of  bFeature, because these really aren't nested features, this is just a  dependency.  5)  After generating the build files from feature.xml, select the build.xml  file in bFeature, and select Run Ant... .  In the ANT dialog, select the  tasks,  in this order:  clean, build.jars, zip.distribution, refresh.  Finish.

I verified this by providing the  parameters -debug and -verbose which shows Ant is starting. When issuing  (manually) the same commandline as the PDE/Runtime workbench uses, and  removing the option -pdelaunch, Ant complains about the '-dev bin' option.  I suppose previously these options were swallowed by the platform  launcher and not passed on  to Ant. Any ideas, suggestions etc will be appreciated.

59032,Problems with warnings logged by pde-build,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Build: I-20040313  When generating the build scripts, pde-build builds and resolves a state. The unsatisfied constraints for the unresolved bundles are then logged as  warnings.  There are several problems with these logs:  1. Every unsatisfied constraint is logged as top-level first-class entry in  the log.   2. The messages printed for each warning are not very informative.  For  example, here is what you will see when a pre-req is missing: ""The following inter-bundle dependencies have not been satisfied: Bundle:  org.eclipse.update.ui name: org.eclipse.help.base - version: null""  3. The message printed contain the word 'bundle' which would confuse the user  who rightly thinks he's dealing with plug-ins and fragments.  To address #1, all the warnings must be merged into a single multistatus since  they are all coming from the same event/operation.  To address #2 and #3, the type of VersionConstraint must be determined (i.e.  PackageSpecification, BundleSpecification, etc.) so that a meaningful message  can be output.  This message would of course contain familiar words like ""plug- in"" and ""fragment"" as necessary.  For consistency with the warnings that PDE/UI outputs upon unsatisfied  constraints, please refer to the class TargetPlatformRegistryLoader in the  org.eclipse.pde.core plug-in.  The code that merges all the warnings into one  multistatus is there.  Also, the code that determines the message to be output  is also there.  The latter might look very familiar as it is (almost)  identical to the one in the osgi plug-in ;-)  It would also be good and consistent if the messages that pde-build outputs  are identical to the one that pde-ui outputs.  So please refer to the  pderesource.properties file in the org.eclipse.pde.internal.core package of  the pde.core plug-in.",2004-04-19 03:33 EDT by Wassim Melhem    ,2004-04-19 14:27 EDT       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/BuildTimeSite.java

67666,Bug 63870 reappeared. Can't export feature with a required binary jar,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Bug 63879 appears to of reappeared with RC2. I have two plugins in a feature:  plugin A has only a jar already built in it plus the plugin.xml, and the build.properties. the plugin.xml has the jar as the library for the plugin.  plugin B has a requirement for plugin A, it also has source in it.   When you do an export feature, plugin B can't find the stuff in the jar in plugin A when compiling the source in plugin B.  Doing some debugging the problem is that the generated build.xml's build.jars target for plugin A doesn't do anything since there is no source to compile.  Then in plugin B for build.jars, it includes plugin A's jar from the build results. But since build.jars of plugin A didn't do anything, there is no jar in there to find.  I tried this with 6/16 driver too, and it still fails.  So you can't build a feature where one of its plugins has a binary jar instead of  source, and another plugin in the feature requires that jar.  This is a regression.

We have a ""pde build product"" that specifies to include the ""icu base"" bundle, presumably for reduced size, rather than the full ICU.   So, _this_ bug is to clarify if that's really needed?   If so, if it is needed, then I guess we can not remove icu.base completely, such as from our build and repo.   If not really needed, then we should remove it from /org.eclipse.pde.build.product.feature/feature.xml which is in the  eclipse.pde.build repo  To be honest, I was surprised to see this ""pde build product"" defined and being built.

488667,React to deltapack removal,VERIFIED           FIXED       ,"""We"" need to decide what to do about me literally removing (stop building) the delta pack. See bug 470932 and the original bug 419246. I would like to do this by M6.   I am fairly sure PDE still has unit tests that assume the delta pack is ""present"" when they run.   I think there are basically 2 alternatives.   1. remove, or disable the tests. (Or similarly, have them conditional based on presence of ""*deltapack.zip"" and if not there, then do not run the tests).   2. during the ""setup"" of PDE's unit tests (that depend on deltapack) then PDE can create their own, in a way similar to how we tell legacy users to do it.   Advantages of '1' is that we are truly moving on and simplifying things.   The advantage of '2' is that there are still ""legacy users"" (apparently) that use it, so as a favor that that part of our community we could still create it and run the unit tests -- to make sure we do not break those legacy users.   There is another ""hidden"" advantage of '2'. It is an indirect test that the ""configuration feature"" exists and roughly works as intended. I happen to know one adapter that still depends on that ""configuration feature"" (but not the delta pack per se).    We do not use the configuration feature ourselves, and we could devise simpler tests for it -- such as only make sure it exists! -- if the PDE team would prefer to simply get rid of the delta pack tests.   If the PDE team wants to continue the tests, then I can tell you one way to create it.   At the begging of your tests run the equivalent of    ./eclipse -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -f createdeltapack.xml  Your starting point for ""createdeltapack.xml"" could be a copy of a file we have in our repo for ""legacy users"", at   http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git/plain/scripts/createdeltapack.xml  You would want to tweak it a little and may want to invoke it programmatically via Java, instead of through literally calling eclipse via 'exec'.

When I did ""touch build.xml"" to create a dummy file (to test permissions, or something), the command completed without an error, but the resulting build script was empty.  After looking at the stack trace in the error log, I saw which plugin and dove into the CVS source.  It ended up that I had the ""custom"" flag set in my build.properties file.  I had some custom ant commands in my project and had forgotten that the flag was set.  I deleted build.xml again and removed the flag and all worked fine.  To make a long story short, I had to do some digging around to figure out what was wrong.  A more verbose error message would be useful.

84017,JNLP export support,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"It turns out that exporting for JNLP is very much like normal exporting.   Features map pretty directly onto .jnlp files.  The config.ini and launcher  code maps on to a top level .jnlp with the appropriate content and <extension>s  for the relevant ""feature"" .jnlp files.  The top level jnlp has main  (startup.jar), the splash and the config.ini values in <property> elements.  The plugin jars that are built need to be signed but otherwise can live in an  update site structure (i.e., in plugins/ dirs) with the .jnlp files in the  features/ dirs next to the related features.  The top level file goes at the  root of the site next to the site.xml file.  This way the plugins on an update  site can also be deployed as JNLP resources.  So, what we need is a way of generating this structure.  There are many  possible ways but in essence there is a toggle to gen the features and/or the  JNLP structure.  Everything else could remain.  Alternatively, we could always just generate the .jnlp files for the features.   They don't cost much.  The JNLP file for the top level may be harder.  If we  have an idea of the original config.ini that would help.  Even still, it is  reasonable that for JNLP deployments the settings might be different.

However in jared form the classpath entries are org.eclipse.swt.gtk64/@dot org.eclipse.swt.win32/@dot org.eclipse.swt.macosx/@dot  which leads to inconsistencies when plugins refer to internal classes (for  example ui.carbon).

88559,[jars] plugin import with source cannot reverse engineer a JARd plugin,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Let me start by explaining how importing a flat plugin with source works: 1. We create a new project for the plugin being imported. 2. We import all the files and folders from the target plugin into the project. 3. for each library declared by the plugin:     a. we locate its corresponding source zip and unzip it in a separate  source folder in the project.     b. we crack the library JAR open and we extract all the resources (i.e.  non-*.class files) and put them in the source folder. 4. We then create an appropriate build.properties file.  When dealing with JARd plugin, it is currently impossible to figure out how to  lay out the plugin project structure, since all files in the JARd plugin are  at the root.  what files/folders should go at the root of the project and what  files/folders should go into a src folder?  Here is the best I could come up with for now: 1. Import src.zip at the root of the project. 2. Import all the non-*.class files from the JARd plugin into the root of the  project. Two problems: 1. the source is at the root of the project which is typically discouraged. 2. what will the source.. entry of the build.properties now contain?  We must be able to support an import-export round trip while keeping the  plugin intact.",2005-03-19 01:22 EST by Wassim Melhem    ,2005-03-23 15:10 EST       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/builder/ModelBuildScriptGenerator.java
88826,Delta pack is incorrect,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"Now that SWT is being shipped as jar, the delta pack is incomplete because the  *so files are not gathered.  Context: The content of a fragment such as motif varies on the platform for which it is  being shipped. For example on linux, it will contain some native libs in    os/linux/x86/a.so  whereas on solaris the libs will be in os/solaris/risc/a.so.  When the packager is running on a non jared target, all the so files are being  copied in the org.eclipse.swt.motif folder and that was fine.  However now that we are shipping as jars, one jar overrides the other which  results in having only one set of library.  Sidenote: One thing that strikes me in this problem, is that SWT does not  respect the rule of one ""id (fragment / plugin)"" == ""content"" == ""one set of  bytes"".  There are several options to solve this problem: 1) SWT ships in multiple fragments:     org.eclipse.swt     org.eclipse.swt.motif (contains the classes)     org.eclipse.swt.motif.solaris (contains the native libs)     org.eclipse.swt.motif.linux (contains the native libs only) This one is nice since the fragments can be enabled on an os basis. On RCP use  case, it forces people to put more things in their config.ini, but the size of  the resulting app is optimal.  2) SWT put all the libs all the time:     org.eclipse.swt     org.eclipse.swt.motif (contains the classes and all the native libs for all  the platforms) Drawback: the download is bigger and the size of apps is bigger.   3) The Delta pack script does some magic to reassemble from the various SWT  jars one big jar. This jar (which is equivalent to the one we would create in  the solution 2) has the same drawbacks than the solution 2.",2005-03-22 18:43 EST by Pascal Rapicault    ,2005-04-25 16:47 EDT       (History)     ,

90514,"hard paths in generated build.xml, what about bytecode-enhancing?",RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"This is effecively the same as bug 85090 but it wasn't filed against PDE yet. In the <pluginname>.jar target in the generated build.xml for a plugin, there are paths to be found like the following: <pathelement path=""../../Programme/eclipse3.1/M5/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.osgi_3.1.0/osgi.jar""/>  This only works on other machines if Eclipse is installed in the same directory structure as on the generating machine, let alone Eclipse on other platforms (e.g. Mac). This is a problem mostly for ""custom = true"" in the build.properties, when one starts off with a generated build.xml. It would be good if the Eclipse install directory could be configured in the build.properties.  I'm using a custom build.xml anyway only because I need some bytecode-enhancement in the build process, which is common at least with JDO based applications. I'm not very ant-savvy, but wouldn't it somehow be possible to configure a bytecode-enhancing task incl. classpath to be invoked between compilation and jar packaging? I mean, in a way that makes custom build unnecessary.   I don't really trust custom build.xml, because I never know what a newly generated build.xml looks like (and potentially must look like) in future versions of Eclipse.",2005-04-06 15:10 EDT by Jörg von Frantzius    ,2005-11-28 05:21 EST       (History)     ,

95078,Filtering out what is copied to the plugin jar,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"In our scenario it is really important to keep our generated jars as small as we can (our code is also available to stand-alone applications).  Because of that, we have to be extra careful with what is copied into the jar.  Right now, this is how the PDE generated build.xml copies the files:  <copy todir=""${temp.folder}/runtime/codegen.jar.bin"" failonerror=""true"" overwrite=""false"">   <fileset dir=""src/"" excludes=""**/*.java, **/package.htm*""/> </copy>  It is great that the package.htm* is being excluded.  But this task is not considering, for example, the ""doc-files"" directories (that usually contains pictures used by the package.html).  It would be great if the snippet above could be generated using a property to define what is supposed to be copied.  For example:  <property name=""notJarredFiles"" value=""**/*.java, **/package.htm*""/> <copy todir=""${temp.folder}/runtime/codegen.jar.bin"" failonerror=""true"" overwrite=""false"">   <fileset dir=""src/"" excludes=""${notJarredFiles}""/> </copy>  This is a very small change that increase a lot the control we have over the build end result with almost zero risk of regressions.

For example, this  allows them to have all elements of a build stamped the same way.  So for  example, a build property like    qualifier.context=Foo might make sense.  Related to this, perhaps we can treat   qualifier=context in the plugin build.properties as a default.  that is, if a plugin/feature  has .qualifier at the end of its version number, assume that the  qualifier=context and don't require the developer to set that property in the  build.properties.",2005-05-16 11:55 EDT by Jeff McAffer    ,2005-05-18 09:30 EDT       (History)     ,org.eclipse.pde.build/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/site/QualifierReplacer.java org.eclipse.pde.build/src_ant/org/eclipse/pde/internal/build/tasks/BuildScriptGeneratorTask.java

97150,[readme] Export  |  Deployable plug-ins and fragments silently drops .class files with long paths,RESOLVED           FIXED       ,"I tend to use descriptive class names and on large projects I wind up nesting packages quite deep. This problem arose for me when I used nested classes (82-character package path, 53-character class name, 59-character inner class name) but a simple test using a ridiculously long package path and a simple class showed the problem too.  When I 'Export...' my plug-in with 'Deployable plug-ins and fragments', the JAR file excludes .class files with very long paths. Personnally, I can live with this (now I know to avoid it) but the problem happens without any warning so it's likely to cause problems for people who don't know about the issue.

I use a small perl script to run through the tree and create build.properties  files if they are not already present, but I think this functionality could be  better handled by PDE.
